# Python MQTT client examples

In this repository we provide examples for:
* Establishing TCP, TLS, and Websocket connection to the MQTT Broker.
* Publish and Subscribe to MQTT topics.
* Transferring files over MQTT connection to the EMQX MQTT broker using the [EMQX File Transfer](https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/v5/file-transfer/introduction.html) feature.
