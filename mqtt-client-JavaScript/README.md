# mqtt-client-JavaScript

This repository contains examples of using the MQTT.js library to create MQTT clients in various JavaScript environments. The examples demonstrate how to connect, subscribe, publish, and receive messages using MQTT.js in the following environments:

- [Node.js](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-Node.js)
- [React](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-React)
- [React Native](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-React-Native)
- [Vue.js](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-Vue3.js)
- [Angular](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-Angular.js)
- [Electron](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-Electron)
- [WebSocket](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-WebSocket)
- [Wechat Mini Program](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-wechat-miniprogram)

All of these examples share similarities in their implementation. You can refer to this tutorial for a comprehensive guide on using MQTT.js: [MQTT.js Tutorial](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-js-tutorial).
